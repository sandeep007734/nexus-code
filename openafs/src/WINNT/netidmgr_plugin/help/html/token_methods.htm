<h1>Token Acquisition Methods</h1>

<p>AFS tokens can be obtained via several different methods. Each of the methods
that are natively supported by the OpenAFS provider is described below. Note
that the OpenAFS provider is extensible and other
acquisition methods may be available other than those listed here.

<h3>Kerberos 5</h3>

<p>A Kerberos 5 service ticket is obtained for the cell and used directly to
construct the AFS token.
</p>

<a name="krb524"/>
<h3>Kerberos 5 to 4 conversion (Kerberos 524)</h3>

<p>A Kerberos 5 service ticket is obtained for the cell and then
converted to a Kerberos 4 service ticket using the krb524 daemon.  The
resulting Kerberos 4 ticket is used to construct the AFS token.
</p>

<a name="krb4"/>
<h3>Kerberos 4</h3>

<p>A Kerberos 4 service ticket is obtained for the cell and then used
to construct the AFS token.  In order to use this method, the identity
must be be configured to obtain Kerberos 4 tickets when obtaining and
renewing credentials.  Otherwise a Kerberos 4 TGT (ticket granting
ticket) will not be available to obtain the service ticket with.</p>

<a name="auto"/>
<h3>Automatic method selection</h3>

<p>When the OpenAFS provider is configured to use automatic method
selection for obtaining an AFS token, it iterates through the Kerberos
5, Kerberos 524 and Kerberos 4 methods until one of them succeeds.  If
a realm for the service ticket is specified, then the realm will be
used for all methods.
</p>

<p>The correct method to use for your AFS cell will depend on the
configuration of the AFS cell and the associated Kerberos realm.  In
most cases, automatic method selection will determine the correct
realm.  However, other cases, the method will have to be specified
explicitly.&nbsp; Contact your AFS cell administrator to find out which token
acquisition methods are supported.</p>
