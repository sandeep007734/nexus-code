<h1>Configuring the AFS Service</h1>

<p>The OpenAFS plug-in allows you to start or stop the AFS
client service, determine the installed version,  and invoke the AFS
Control Panel.  This is provided via the AFS configuration panel in
the NetIDMgr configuration dialog, as seen below:
</p>

<p>Depending on the status of the service, either the <span
class="pre">Stop service</span> or the <span class="pre">Start
service</span> buttons will be enabled.  If the service is in a state
where it will not accept these control requests, then both buttons will
be disabled.
</p>

<p>The <span class="pre">Version</span> field and the <span
class="pre">Company</span> fields are populated based on the resources
found in the <span class="pre">afsd_service.exe</span> binary.  This
is the main binary that provides the AFS client service.  Unless the
build of OpenAFS that you have installed is a private build, the
version should correspond to the release of OpenAFS that is installed
on your machine.</p>

<p>Clicking the <span class="pre">Open AFS Control Panel...</span>
will open the AFS configuration utility.</p>
