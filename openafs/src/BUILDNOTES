In this file you'll find notes to help you build OpenAFS on various platforms.

Redhat 7.0 (i386_linux22): 
	src/venus/kdump.c may fail to compile with the gcc included with 
	RedHat 7.0; You'll need to use kgcc to compile it.  You should 
	be able to use kgcc to compile all of AFS. Just add CC=kgcc 
	to your make arguments.

	When building for multiple kernels in one dest tree,
	if the kernel version string which UTS_RELEASE is defined to in 
	include/linux/version.h matches the last kernel you built for, 
        the previous kernel module will be overwritten.

Redhat 7.1 (i386_linux24): 
	src/venus/kdump.c may fail to compile.

	You will need pam-devel installed to compile the included
	PAM module.

	When building for multiple kernels in one dest tree,
	if the kernel version string which UTS_RELEASE is defined to in 
	include/linux/version.h matches the last kernel you built for, 
        the previous kernel module will be overwritten.

HPUX 11.0 (hp_ux110):
	Does not currently build libafs, which means no afs client support,
	however, the client tools, and all of the server code does get built.
	
	For future kernel development, the KernDevKit package from the CoreOS
	media is required.

HPUX 10.2 (hp_ux102):
	Does not currently build libafs, which means no afs client support,
	however, the client tools, and all of the server code does get built.
	
	Requires that the DCE-CoreTools and possible the KernDevKit package
	from CoreOS media be installed.
