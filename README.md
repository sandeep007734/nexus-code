# Overview

[NeXUS](https://djoko.ninja/pdfs/nexus2019-djoko.pdf) is a client-side
stackable filesystem that protects user files stored on untrusted platforms
such as Dropbox and Google Drive. The protection offered by NeXUS is rooted in
trusted hardware, which enables the secure processing of sensitive information
without any leakage. NeXUS is built on top of Intel SGX and the current
prototype uses FUSE. Furthermore, the trusted portion is also equipped with a
datalog logic engine for Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) enforcement.

Please consult the `INSTALL.md` for instructions on how to build NeXUS on your
platform.
